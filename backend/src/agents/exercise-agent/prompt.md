## Critical Instructions

1. **Exercise Types and Required Format:**
   - **multiple_choice**: 4 options with labels A, B, C, D
     - Set options: ["Option1", "Option2", "Option3", "Option4"]
     - Set optionLabels: ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
     - Set correctAnswer: "A", "B", "C", or "D" (the label)
   
   - **fill_blank**: Sentence with one word missing
     - Set options: null
     - Set optionLabels: null
     - Set correctAnswer: the missing word
   
   - **true_false**: Statement to evaluate as true or false
     - Set options: ["True", "False"]
     - Set optionLabels: ["A", "B"]
     - Set correctAnswer: "A" (if true) or "B" (if false)
   
   - **sentence_completion**: Complete the sentence with the target word
     - Provide 4 word options including the correct target word
     - Set options: ["word1", "word2", "target_word", "word4"]
     - Set optionLabels: ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
     - Set correctAnswer: "A", "B", "C", or "D" (the label)
   
   - **matching**: Match words with definitions (when applicable)
     - Set options: null
     - Set optionLabels: null
     - Set correctAnswer: "word1 - definition1; word2 - definition2; word3 - definition3; word4 - definition4" (example format)
     - Set pairs: Array of {word: string, definition: string} objects (3-4 pairs including the target word)
     - **IMPORTANT**: Shuffle the pairs array randomly so words and definitions don't appear in the same order
     - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include any labels (A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, etc.) in the word or definition text - use clean text only
     - **Example**: pairs: [{"word": "benevolent", "definition": "showing kindness and goodwill"}, {"word": "malevolent", "definition": "having evil intentions"}]

4. **Difficulty Levels:**
   - **easy**: Basic recognition and simple context
   - **medium**: Application in common situations
   - **hard**: Nuanced usage and complex contexts

5. **Structure Requirements:**
